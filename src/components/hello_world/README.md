## HelloWorld

The idea here is to show how declare a component with maximum check types.

- with `HelloWorld` type is possible to use props / setup result in the render function
- with `HelloWorldEvents` type is possible to use events in parent tsx component
- HelloWord component has to define `vSlots` and `events` in props to fix tsc check
