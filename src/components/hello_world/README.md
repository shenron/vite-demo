## HelloWorld

The idea here is to show how declare a component with maximum check types.

- with `HelloWorld` type is possible to use props / setup result in the render function
- with `HelloWorldEvents` type is possible to check emits in `useHelloWorld`
- HelloWord component has to define `vSlots` as props to fix tsc check in parent component
