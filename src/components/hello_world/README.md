## HelloWorld

The idea here is to show how declare a component with maximum check types.

- with `HelloWorld` type is possible to use props and setup result in the render function
- `useHelloWorld` emit events defined in `HelloWord`
- HelloWord component has to define `vSlots` as props to fix tsc check in parent component
